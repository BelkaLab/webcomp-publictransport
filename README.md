# ROUTEPLANNER

This project contains all the web components of the greenmobility project.
You can find all the information about it on the official website [https://www.greenmobility.bz.it/it/](https://www.greenmobility.bz.it/it/).

## Why

IDM wants to break up, in reusable and independent components, its website. Using those web components a developer can integrate every website with ready to use and up to date data.

## Choices

To create more structured and maintainable web components we have used [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), more specifically the [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) implementation.

Using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) we can manage all the components as monolith repository but divided in packages.

So the project can benefit of:

- a better project structure
- a better dependencies management
- a better way to pack up components
- and every component is isolated with it's own dependencies

CSS styles are transpiled using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

We are using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for the bundle creation.

## Getting Started

Follow the instruction here below for the development instructions.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node (global)
- Yarn (global)
- Lerna (global)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install yarn project's dependencies

```
yarn
```

To install all the dependencies of the packages:

```
lerna bootstrap
```

Because they are managed using Lerna.

### Development

Start the lerna pipeline with:

```
yarn wc
```

This will watch the files in every package configured in the right way to create a Webpack bundle.

#### Webpack Dev Server

Alternatively the webpack development server can be opened with:

```
yarn start
```

### Production

Build all widgets using a `production` config of Webpack:

```
yarn bc
```

The destination for the resulting code will be the `dist` folder, located at the root of the project.

## Development results

To see the components in action while working on, go to the folder `work` in the main folder and run:

```
sh serve.sh
```

This will serve the "work in progress" website on [http://0.0.0.0:8000/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/) url.

## Deployment

To deploy the web components:

- Use the snippets that you will find in the served `work` folder, this will use an internal CDN.
- Take the production bundle created with the command `yarn bc` and use it as a normal javascript script.

In any case I suggest you to check the snippets of the first point.

### Attributes

| Attribute name     | Description                                                                  | Example                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `destination`      | coordinates of the destination in the following format: "longitude:latitude" | `destination="11.1604034:46.6684672"`        | the `longitude:latitude` format is the opposite of what you can find on many websites, including google maps that uses the `latitude, longitude` format |
| `destination-name` | display name of the destination                                              | `destination-name="Terme di Merano, Merano"` |                                                                                                                                                         |
|                    |                                                                              |                                              |                                                                                                                                                         |
